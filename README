get user's friend list
create user objects for each friend
create friend relationship
update every hour
for each user that has an access token (users that have logged into site)
  do incremental search for all messages containing friend screen names

probably need to fork the twitter-auth gem to either:
  * add a twitter_id column obtained from the /users/show result's id field
  * actually create the new user record with id = actual twitter id

finalize tweet model

figure out a friend model to join users together
  * user.followers
  * user.friends

http://twitter.com/users/show.xml?screen_name=dmauldin

http://apiwiki.twitter.com/REST-API-Documentation

possible names:
  tweeterly  = generic
  twelevance = hard to type
  twirble    = no connection
  twerla     = doesn't really have any connection
* flockle    = somewhat hard to type
  tweetclan  = clan has kind of a negative feel
  metaclan   = clan has kind of a negative feel
  tweetilary = connection?
  twitilary  = too hard to type

When adding tests, be sure to add a test for using from 1 to 30 screen names for a search.  Ran into a problem today (apr-15-09) where if there was just enough names to have 1 spill over into the next query by itself, it'd get treated as an array and not a string.

ideas for caching...
  quickly display existing tweets and a loading animation while fetching new tweets
  could insert tweets into list as they arrive
    how to do that without annoying the user by bumping the list down every second or so...

if the user is logged into the site, they should be able to post directly from the page.
